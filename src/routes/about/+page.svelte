    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      The Candidate Matcher helps voters discover which candidates best align with their views on important issues in the current election.
    </p>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why We Built This</h2>
    <p>
      Finding the candidate who best represents your values can be challenging. Campaign websites often focus on selective issues, and media coverage can emphasize personality over policy. Our goal is to:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
      <li>Help voters see how their views align with each candidate across multiple issues</li>
      <li>Provide a neutral, transparent tool that doesn't favor any candidate or ideology</li>
      <li>Encourage issue-based voting decisions rather than party-line voting</li>
      <li>Simplify the process of comparing candidates on policy positions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Our Values</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Neutrality</h3>
    <p>
      We're committed to presenting issues and candidate positions without bias. Our questions are carefully worded to avoid leading language, and we base candidate positions on factual public statements and voting records.
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Transparency</h3>
    <p>
      We believe in being open about how our tool works:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8 mb-4">
      <li>Our <a href="/methodology" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">methodology page</a> explains in detail how we match users to candidates</li>
      <li>Our code is open-source and available for review</li>
      <li>We clearly explain how we determine candidate positions</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Privacy</h3>

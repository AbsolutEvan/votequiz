        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Quiz The Vote represents a breakthrough in political engagement tools for newsrooms. Unlike traditional political quizzes 
          that focus on surface-level policy positions, our platform helps voters connect with candidates based on 
          substantive policy positions and local issues that matter to their community.
        </p>

        <h2>Why SVO Matters</h2>
        <p>
          After 40+ years of psychological research, we know that people's political preferences stem from deeper 
          social orientations rather than just policy knowledge. Our questions reveal whether someone is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Prosocial/Cooperative:</strong> Values collective benefit and collaboration</li>
          <li><strong>Individualistic:</strong> Focuses on personal outcomes and self-reliance</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive:</strong> Motivated by relative advantage and winning</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For Newsrooms</h2>
        <p>
          We've designed this platform specifically for journalists and civic organizations who want to engage 
          their audiences with more meaningful political content. No coding required - just copy our template, 
          add your local candidates, and embed the quiz on your website.
        </p>

        <h2>Technical Innovation</h2>
        <p>
          Our platform supports multiple question types and advanced matching algorithms:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scale-based questions (5-point agreement, 3-point support)</li>
          <li>Multiple choice and categorical questions</li>
          <li>Jaccard similarity for complex preference matching</li>
          <li>Weighted topic importance based on user priorities</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <p>
          This project is open source and built with modern web technologies including SvelteKit, 
          TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. We believe in transparency and continuous improvement through 
          community contributions.
